# Pivodev - configuration for isolated docker-based developer environments

When working on projects often I come into compatability and installation problems. As a result I decided to create set of docker based configuration files for automatic creating of development environments.

Basic functionality will include:
- [ ] Neovim base configuration and templates for creating IDE specific to development requirements
- [ ] Set of dockerfiles for specific projecs

Support:
- [ ] C#
- [ ] C/C++
- [ ] Python
- [ ] http/css/js
- [ ] Go
- [ ] Rust
- [ ] Lua
- [ ] PostgreSQL
- [ ] MySQL
